      "content": "HONG KONG — Analysis of Covid-19 cases in Beijing suggests that no new variants emerged from China’s recent outbreak, according to a study published Wednesday. Facing rare mass unrest after nearly three years of strict “zero-Covid” policies, the Chinese government dropped most restrictions on Dec. 7. The sudden change unleashed the coronavirus over the winter on a population of 1.4 billion people who had barely been exposed to it, raising fears that the outbreak could produce a new variant of concern and leading dozens of countries, including the United States, to impose testing and other curbs on travelers from China.But the Chinese-funded study, which was published in The Lancet, found that of 413 sampled infections in Beijing, all belonged to existing Covid variants. The most common were omicron subvariants BA.5.2 and BF.7, which together accounted for more than 90% of local infections.The samples were randomly selected for genomic sequencing from a larger group of 2,881 high-quality samples collected in Beijing from Nov. 14 to Dec. 20, 2022."

      "content": "Kicking off their new oversight role, House Republicans will take aim at the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars lost to fraud among the $5 trillion in Covid relief funds distributed by both the Trump and Biden administrations. The new chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., labeled pandemic fraud “the biggest fleecing of America in American history.” Though the committee’s investigations have just begun, Comer said he believes no meaningful changes have been made at the federal or state levels in the three years since the pandemic relief programs were initiated. “Right now, I have no confidence in the federal government’s ability to prevent fraud.”"

      "content": "At a House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday, members of Congress from both parties pressed the Secret Service for more information about foreign state-sponsored hackers stealing Covid relief funds, citing exclusive reporting from NBC News about fraud by hackers linked to the Chinese government. In December, NBC News broke the story that APT41, a hacking group linked to the Chinese government, stole at least $20 million in U.S. Covid relief benefits, including Small Business Administration loans and unemployment insurance funds in over a dozen states, according to the Secret Service. On Wednesday, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill, pushed witness David Smith, the assistant director of the Office of Investigations at the Secret Service, to reveal the full extent of cyberattacks by such groups on state computer systems. “Since that article came out, I got to believe that they’ve probably targeted a lot of states beyond a dozen,” Krishnamoorthi said."
